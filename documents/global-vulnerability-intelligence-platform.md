# Introduction {#introduction}

The vulnerability system core is shaking and we need to work on both a short term solution and a long term solution. This document focuses on the long term solution \- a global federated system for vulnerability management.

These thoughts started rolling around in my head when the EU legislation became clear. I heard then (two years ago) that the NVD was about 25 people and had a lack of funding. This worried me. Then it became worse. With the recent cuts by the US administration it became even more clear that there needs to be a global funding to the vulnerability tracking system.

I would like multiple organisations to be part of this effort. Hopefully across the world. Maybe a short-lived task force should be formed where multiple parties can join the discussion and move forward. My personal feeling is that this will take years to complete and any change needs to happen gradually.

## Let’s not focus on the technical aspect first {#let’s-not-focus-on-the-technical-aspect-first}

In many discussions (yes, I’ve had a lot) we quickly go from organisational issues to technical details \- PURL or CPE, JSON or XML, synchronisation, federation… We love those discussions and we’re good at them.

Those issues can and will be solved. **The first focus has to be organisational** \- how do we take the first steps, which parties need to be involved, which global organisations and states/unions need to be part of the solution, at start and in the long run? Issues we don’t solve by writing technical specs or code.

## Global involvement is essential {#global-involvement-is-essential}

We just have to give it time, hash out issues and slowly move forward. Many persons, organisations, vendors, academia and authorities need to be able to raise their voice, take co-ownership and help the process move forward. Patience will be a needed virtue.

This process needs to be funded to enable maintainers to focus, document and support the process moving forward. How do we organise that in the best way?

In parallel we can create test labs to develop platforms, APIs and solutions for the technical platform and move forward in gradual, well-defined steps. Steps that we know how to handle, have experience of and love doing. Which is why we need to start that process after the first one \- building the organisational home for a global multi-stakeholder platform.

# **A call for action:**  **The path towards a global platform for vulnerability reporting** {#a-call-for-action:-the-path-towards-a-global-platform-for-vulnerability-reporting}

**Summary:** We propose building a global platform for vulnerability reporting and alerting, based on manufacturer control of submitted data, third party data providers for additional data, supported by funding and steering from multiple sources representing global stakeholders. The current platform is mainly funded by a single state and has a tradition of a third party adding essential data like component names, without any influence by the product owner. As legislations are coming into place for cybersecurity in products, it is essential that there is a global view and coordination of this essential system \- for users and manufacturers both. Users of products needs to be able to answer the question: “Is the product safe to use?”

This document starts with the current situation, analyses various problems with it and then moves on to propose a way forward, building a global multi-stakeholder platform.

## The current situation and background {#the-current-situation-and-background}

There are many vulnerability platforms, but the core one is the CVE program’s database. This is a short introduction to the CVE and NVD. See references below for pointers to more information.  
Let’s focus on a few actors and concepts:

* **CVE ID: Common Vulnerability and Exposures ID** \- a unique identifier for a vulnerability  
* **CVE Format:** A standard format for machine-parseable vulnerability reports  
* **CVE Numbering Authorities (CNA):** Organisations, ranging from commercial manufacturers, authorities to open source projects, that create entries in the CVE database.  
* **CVE Program:** An organisation funded by US Dept homeland security that manage the database and organise working groups to coordinate, develop best current practises and rules and formats  for CVEs and CNAs. Operated by MITRE. Launched as the CVE List in 1999  
* **ADP, Additional data providers**: Organisations that enrich CVEs by providing additional data.

A CNA that discovers or gets a report about a vulnerability, requests a unique CVE ID. When ready to publish, the CVE is publicly disclosed using the CVE format. After publication, other providers can publish additional data, currently only CISA.

The combined data stream has been used as input for the National Vulnerability Database, NVD. The NVD used to enrich CVE data with an identifier (CPE) for the software and manufacturer, the CVSS severity score and CWE categorisation of the vulnerability.

### Users of these databases {#users-of-these-databases}

These databases are used by software platforms that wants to check for vulnerabilities and exploits based on a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) or by other means.   
There are other databases, both commercial and freely available, that all use the same identifier system \- CVE. Others use their own identifiers but commonly refers to the CVE identifier as an alias.

### Other vulnerability platforms {#other-vulnerability-platforms}

* **OSV:** An Open Source project funded by Google. [https://osv.dev/](https://osv.dev/)  
  The overall OSV ecosystem enables a level of decentralisation that is currently being discussed in various circles. OSV.dev aggregates currently \~22 decentralised home databases that are publishing OSV-formatted records.  
* **European vulnerability database (EUVD):** This is work in progress. ENISA got the mandate to create this database in the NIS2 directive. The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) also relies on the EUVD.  
* **Commercial databases:** Many of these offerings enrich the CVE/NVD databases with additional information and risk analysis  
* **KEV:** The Known Exploited Vulnerabilities database is operated by CISA and focuses on a few CVEs that has been used by offenders.  
* **GITHUB Advisory database:** Security vulnerability database inclusive of CVEs and GitHub originated security advisories from the world of open source software.  
* **Japan Vulnerability Notes (JVN):** A portal site on IT product vulnerability information handled in the Japanese framework called "The Information Security Early Warning Partnership". It provides detailed information on each vulnerability including a summarized description, affected products, possible impacts, solutions, vendor statements, and reference documents.

## Problems with the current system {#problems-with-the-current-system}

The current system has served the global community well, but as with any system built when the number of vendors, products and open source projects were fewer and the focus on cybersecurity much lower, it’s time to take a step backwards and review the situation.

* **NAMING**: In a smaller ecosystem, it was natural for the NVD to assign enumeration of product names and vendors. However, with a growing number of active vendors and products, this no longer works on a global scale. Even within the managed name space, there are several examples of a single vendor being given multiple names. This leads to software that “guesses” the CPE name by adding multiple permutations for a single component, in the hope to find a match.  
* The CPE as a vendor and product name identifier is an old system that has worked well, but new naming schemes are being developed and a planned migration needs to take place. For this to work, coordination between client implementations as well as services and APIs needs to take place.  
* **Limited funding**: As we expect the number of vulnerabilities reported to grow exponentially, the current funding is likely not enough. We’ve seen the problems exposed by the NVD as the number of CVEs reported in 2024 grew dramatically.

## Requirements for a new solution {#requirements-for-a-new-solution}

* **FEDERATION**: A global system needs to be operated by many actors, following the same rules and formats for managing vulnerability data. By using the same namespace, collisions in identifiers (CVE) will be avoided.  
* **GLOBAL**: We need a multistake-holder solution with global participation  
* **FREE**: The data shall be freely accessible and replicable worldwide.  
* **INTEROPERABILITY**: The API for lookups needs to be standardised, as well as the data format.  
* **NAMING**: Vendors and creators need to be in control of their identifiers (DNS name) and the product names, no one else. The system may have a small managed namespace for software creators without a DNS name registration, which of course can’t guarantee any similarity with a natural name in order to avoid collisions.  
* **GLOBAL NAMESPACE**: The identifier for a vulnerability needs to be globally unique  
* **EXTENSIBLE**: Data added should not be modified by a third party, but a third party may be able to append their data to an issue. Users may choose who to trust.  
* **TRUSTED and AUTHORITATIVE**: There needs to be a high level of trust in the databases, by using digital signatures and transparency systems to monitor the systems for invalid changes in data. This database should be authoritative for legislations and vertical standards world wide. All vulnerabilities must be independently verifiable.  
* **REPLICATION FRIENDLY:** The data needs to be replication friendly. One reason is that APIs can be used to track the content of SBOMs for a specific IP/Enterprise and having data locally is much faster. In addition, local data offloads the traffic from the API endpoint.

## The way forward: A global federated system {#the-way-forward:-a-global-federated-system}

The way forward is to form a federated system that is controlled by a multi-stakeholder global organisation, inspired by organisations like ICANN that manage the DNS system.

Vulnerabilities and related information is a global resource provided in order to make systems more secure and protect the citizens from cybersecurity incidents. It is imperative that this information is globally available for free and not locked in by commercial or political interests.

There is a lot of experience and knowledge on how to operate this system in the CVE Program, which is a good starting point for building a larger ecosystem.

## Actors {#actors}

There are many actors producing, reporting, evaluating and using the data in these platforms. It’s a system that has many stakeholders that needs to be represented.

Borrowing some terminology from the EU Cyber Resilience Act:

* **Manufacturer:** An entity that creates products with digital content, often with commercial intent  
* **Open Source Project:** An organisation, with or without a legal entity, that produce Free and Open Source Software  
* **Open Source Steward**: A non-profit organisation that organise projects and maintain a set of standards in regards of security for them to follow  
* **User**: A user of a product with digital content  
* **Third party researcher/reporter**: A security researcher or user  
* **Market authority:** And governmental organisation that monitors market actors for compliance with regulation

## Finding an organisation or setting up a new {#finding-an-organisation-or-setting-up-a-new}

One requirement is that the organisation operating and coordinating this system needs to be trusted by all interested parties \- like governments, the Open Source ecosystem, enterprises, NGOs, and consumers. Setting up a new organisation will take time, resources and it will have to work hard to gain trust by all parties. The organization that will be responsible for this vulnerability database MUST be well funded and supported and committed to operating the service as international critical infrastructure following a Service Level Agreement (SLA) to ensure reliability and resilience of its operations. 

A separate document will be used to give an overview of potential candidates and pros and cons with these choices. Another document will outline requirements of a new organisation.

It has to be noted that the trust now lies on the CVE program ([www.cve.org](http://www.cve.org)) and any solution will either be a change of the CVE program or an addition that includes the CVE program. Disrupting this program will only harm the industry.

## Summary: It’s time to take joint action {#summary:-it’s-time-to-take-joint-action}

While the current CVE program works and the organisation is working hard to improve, we need to plan for a global uptake in the number of reported vulnerabilities due to new legislation. The growth during the last couple of years will continue, and possibly even be more massive. In order to prepare for this and build a stronger ecosystem, it is now time to start working together building a stronger platform for the cybersecurity of the global community.
