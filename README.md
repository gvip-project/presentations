## GVIP Summit January 28th, 2026, Brussels, Belgium

As part of the [Open Source Week](https://opensourceweek.eu) in Brussels, we're organising the
GVIP Summit - a full day conference focusing on vulnerability management and databases. We'll take
a look into the history, the current situation and into the future. Together
we'll set the direction of future work within the GVIP project.

More details will follow soon. If you want to participate - follow GVIP on
LinkedIn for updates or join the cve@owasp.org mailing list and we'll let you know
as we soon will open for registration (limited seats).

Participation will be free. If you want to contribute as a speaker - contact Olle E Johansson today!
